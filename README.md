# Neural-Network

In this repository, we present a new direction for increasing the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by proposing to replace the linear transforms in DNNs by the **B-cos transform**. 

The B-cos transform is designed to be compatible with existing architectures and we show that it can easily be integrated into common models such as *VGGs*, *ResNets*, *InceptionNets*, and *DenseNets*, whilst maintaining similar performance.
